                    <p>
                    Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques have become the de facto solution to drive human 
                    progress and more specifically, automation. In the last years, the world’s economy is gravitating towards such industry 
                    and the expectation of growth is not withering away. Additionally, these trends have been further exacerbated by the novel
                    COVID-19 pandemic, which paralyzed the world’s economy and made evident the need for even more automation to provide safer 
                    and more reliable services and also to aid in the agile discovery of life-saving drugs and vaccines. To support those kinds 
                    of applications, cognitive architectures are designed and deployed to materialize advances in the aforementioned fields.
                    However, although the newest cognitive designs are improving by the day, the amount of challenges ahead for cognitive 
                    systems is still overwhelming. With existing solutions reaching functional maturity, design considerations are now 
                    pivoting to new aspects like energy scaling, reliable operation, safety guarantees, or even security properties. 
                    This has led to a very diverse variety of hardware and software systems, either tailored to their specific applications
                    or designed for general-purpose usage, which calls for a wider understanding of how cognitive architecture’s design should be tackled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In that context, the CogArch workshop aims at bringing together the necessary know-how to design cognitive 
                    architectures from a holistic point of view, tackling all their design considerations from the algorithms to platforms 
                    in all the different fields that cognitive architectures will soon occupy, from autonomous cars
                    to critical tasks in avionics or space or even personalized medicine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The CogArch workshop already had four successful editions, bringing together experts and knowledge on the most novel 
                    design ideas for cognitive systems. This workshop capitalizes on synergizing industrial and academic effort in order
                    to provide a better understanding of cognitive systems and key concepts of their design.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Hardware and software design considerations are gravitating towards AI applications, as those have been proven extremely
                      useful in a wide variety of fields, from edge computing in autonomous cars to cloud-based computing for personalized medicine. 
                      The recent years have brought about a boom in start-ups and novel platforms that constantly offer improvements in performance 
                      and accuracy for the aforementioned applications. As this kind of cognitive architectures evolve, system designers have to 
                      incorporate many different considerations, and this has led to a very diverse field in terms of available solutions.</p>

                    <p>The CogArch workshop solicits formative ideas and new product offerings in this general space that cover all the design
                      aspects of cognitive systems, from algorithms improving cognition to design methodologies that improve non-functional 
                      considerations like energy efficiency, security, agile design, programmability, or reliability. </p>

					<p>
						Federated learning is a distributed machine learning approach that enables organizations to collaborate on projects
						without sharing sensitive data, such as, patient records, financial data, or classified. The basic premise behind
						federated learning is that the model moves to meet the data rather than the data moving to meet the model. Dr. Reina
						will describe potential security gaps in federated learning and explain how trusted execution environments can help
						mitigate these threats.

          <h3>Extreme-Scale Deep Neural Networks: The Need for Sparsity and Flexible Hardware</h3>
          <h4><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nataliavassilieva" target="_blank">Natalia Vassilieva, Ph.D. (Technical Product Manager at Cerebras Systems)</a></h4>
					<p>
            Advances in Deep Learning over the past several years have demonstrated two paths to better models: scale and algorithmic innovation. Brute-force scaling of model parameter count increases model capacity, and when presented with enough training data, has shown better performance in many domains. However, the advantages of large-scale models come with price: they require a lot of compute to be trained, much more than can be delivered by a single traditional processor. Today clusters of 10s to even 1000s of processors are commonly used to train large neural networks. This approach to scaling is not sustainable. We need algorithmic innovations to find more efficient neural network architectures and training methods. This requires more flexible hardware to develop and test novel approaches. In this talk, we will look at the trends of extreme-scale deep learning models, discuss implications for hardware, and share how the Cerebras CS-1 addresses these requirements for both scale and flexibility of compute.
